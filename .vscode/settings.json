Use the imperative mood and be specific about what was changed and why. Avoid generic messages like 'Update code' or 'Fix bug'. If multiple unrelated changes are present, summarize them in a single message. Ensure the message is no longer than 50 characters. Be extremely detailed with the file changes and the reason for the changes."
