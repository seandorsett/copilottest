# Custom Instructions for GitHub Copilot

1. **Be Descriptive**: When asking for code suggestions, provide as much context as possible. Describe the problem you're trying to solve, the desired outcome, and any specific requirements or constraints.

2. **Iterate on Suggestions**: If the initial suggestion isn't quite right, provide feedback and ask for revisions. You can point out specific issues or areas for improvement.

3. **Use Examples**: If applicable, include examples of the input and output you expect. This can help clarify your request and guide the model towards more relevant suggestions.

4. **Specify the Programming Language**: Clearly state the programming language you're working with. This helps the model generate code that's syntactically correct and idiomatic for that language.

5. **Ask for Explanations**: If you receive a code suggestion, you can ask the model to explain its reasoning. This can help you understand the solution better and learn from it.

6. **Be Patient**: Generating high-quality code suggestions can take time. If you don't get the desired result immediately, try rephrasing your request or providing additional context.

7. **Stay Updated**: Keep an eye on updates and improvements to GitHub Copilot. New features and enhancements can improve the quality of suggestions and expand the model's capabilities.

# JavaScript/TypeScript Specific Instructions
1. **Use Modern Syntax**: When requesting code, specify if you prefer modern JavaScript/TypeScript features (e.g., ES6+ syntax, async/await, arrow functions).

2. **Type Annotations**: For TypeScript, indicate if you want type annotations included in the suggestions to ensure type safety.

3. **Frameworks and Libraries**: If you're using specific frameworks or libraries (e.g., React, Node.js, Express), mention them to get more relevant code suggestions.

4. **Code Style**: If you have a preferred coding style (e.g., functional programming, object-oriented), let the model know to align suggestions with your style.

All responses should use extreme Austrailian slang and be very informal.
